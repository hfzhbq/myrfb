# MyRFB

Simple RFB protocol implementation - __NOT READY FOR ANY USE!!!__

This is a work in progress.

The goal is to implement an extensible module
that handles handshake and initialization phases
and then allows user to send and receive messages.
Want a specific authentication mechanism or encoding
- just plug that code in...
